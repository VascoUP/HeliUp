# EndlessRocket

Game concept:
Endless game with some resource management and upgradables.
It's a flappy bird like game, but with a helicopter. The helicopter will have a fuel tank which you'll have to manage so it doesn't go empty.
The tank can be filled by going through some suspended items.
Those suspended items can also be some helicopter upgradables (or downgradables), like a helicopter boost, or an increased fuel tank, and so on.

The other idea would be to upgrade the helicopter every time a game ends (on the menu), but we got to the conclusion that that would make the gameplay less interesting.

This game gives the player a set of decisions that he has to make to get farther than he did before. 
The decisions lie on the fact that collecting the items won't be easy and might risk losing right away, so if it's not necessary the player can choose not to pick up some items.

The goal of the game is to get as far as possible.

NO MORE ROCKETS, it's a helicopter, deal with it.
Everything else stands as described.

A few more aditions are some skyscrapers as obstacles that you have to go around.
The background will be static.
